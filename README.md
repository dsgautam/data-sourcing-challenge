# data-sourcing-challenge
Module 6 Challenge Assignment

# Solution 
1) Access NY Times API and get movie titles using the criteria provided
2) Get Movie details from the TMDB API
3) Merge NT Times Data with the TMDb data, clean, and send the output to a CSV

# Testing consideration

NYT API
1) There are 200 entries extracted from NYT API. 10 entries per page
2) Add 12 second sleep delay after each page access to keep within the API access rules

TMDB API
1) While it is a movie database, not all movies are necesarily found in the database. 
2) Movie details are accessed using movie_id (see below)
3) The API limits 50 access each second. The program has a 1 second delay added to stay within the rules of API acces
4) Some data are stored in relevant colummns as dictionaries and lists. Appropriate data wrangling and transformation methods should be conisdered for making it readable

# Source code
1) retrieve_movie_data.ipynb

# API keys
API keys are generated by each individual and stored locally for accessing them throug the jupyter-notebook
1) NYT Times
   url = "https://api.nytimes.com/svc/search/v2/articlesearch.json?" is used for searching articles / reviews using the filter query and other parameters.
2) TMDB DB:
   "https://api.themoviedb.org/3/search/movie?query=" is used for get the movie_id using a search text.
   "https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/" is used for getting movie_details using movie_id

# Output
1) movies.csv
